## 1. Certificate Layout Improvements

- **Smaller cards**: Certificate size reduced from 300x400px to 220x300px
- **Faster animation**: Speed increased from 20s to 15s

.certificates-track {
    gap: 12px;  /* was 20px */
    animation: scroll 15s linear infinite;  /* was 20s */
}

.certificate-card {
    min-width: 220px;  /* was 300px */
