# 🎯 GitHub Pages - Final Setup Steps

## ✅ Repository is Public! Great!

Now on the **same page** where you are (Settings → Pages), scroll down to see the deployment options.

---

## 📋 What to Do Next:

### **On the GitHub Pages settings page, scroll down and you'll see:**

1. **"Build and deployment" section**
2. **"Source" dropdown** - This is what you need!

---

## 🎬 Exact Steps:

### **Option 1: Using GitHub Actions (Recommended - I already set this up)**

1. Scroll down on the Pages settings page
2. Look for **"Source"** dropdown
3. Click it and select: **"GitHub Actions"**
4. That's it! The workflow I created will auto-deploy

### **Option 2: Simple Branch Deploy (If you can't find GitHub Actions)**

1. Scroll down to **"Source"** dropdown
2. Select: **"Deploy from a branch"**
3. Under **"Branch"**: Select **`main`**
4. Under **"Folder"**: Select **`/ (root)`**
5. Click **"Save"**

## 🔍 If You Still Can't See the Options:

The page might be showing you the "Upgrade" notice first because it just became public. Try these:

### **Method 1: Refresh the page**
```
Press F5 or Cmd+R to refresh
The options should appear below the "Upgrade" message
```

### **Method 2: Wait 1 minute**
```
GitHub might need a moment to process the public status change
Wait 60 seconds, then refresh the page
```

### **Method 3: Check Actions Tab**
Since I already pushed the workflow, check if it's running:
- Go to: https://github.com/Kartik1705/Portfolio-Website/actions
- You might see a deployment already running!
- If it's running, your site will be live in 2 minutes automatically!

## 🚀 Quick Check - Is It Already Deploying?

Click this link: https://github.com/Kartik1705/Portfolio-Website/actions

**If you see a workflow running** (yellow dot or checkmark):
- ✅ Great! It's already deploying!
- Wait 2-3 minutes
- Your site will be live at: https://kartik1705.github.io/Portfolio-Website/

**If you see "No workflows run yet"**:
- Go back to Settings → Pages
- Scroll down past the "Upgrade" box
- Set Source to "GitHub Actions" or "Deploy from a branch"

## 📸 What the Settings Should Look Like:

After scrolling down, you should see:
```
