## 🔧 Technical Details

### Skills Data Structure
```javascript
const skillsData = {
    productFrameworks: [/* 18 frameworks */],
    technicalSkills: [/* 23 tools */]
};
```

### Certificate Animation
```css
@keyframes scroll {
    0% { transform: translateX(0); }
    100% { transform: translateX(calc(-300px * 12 - 20px * 12)); }
}
```
- Duration: 20 seconds (faster than previous 30s)
- Seamless loop with duplicated content
- Trackpad scroll overrides animation

### Trackpad Scroll Implementation
```javascript
container.addEventListener('wheel', (e) => {
    if (Math.abs(e.deltaX) > Math.abs(e.deltaY)) {
        e.preventDefault();
        container.scrollLeft += e.deltaX;
    } else {
        e.preventDefault();
        container.scrollLeft += e.deltaY;
    }
}, { passive: false });
```

## 🚀 Next Steps (If Needed)

1. **Google Calendar Link**: Update the schedule meeting button URL with your actual Google Calendar scheduling link
2. **Profile Image**: Ensure profile.jpg exists in assets/images/
3. **Research Paper Images**: If you have actual images for the placeholder papers, add them to assets/images/research/
4. **Testing**: Verify all links work correctly
5. **Certificate Images**: Ensure all certificate images maintain good quality with `object-fit: contain`
