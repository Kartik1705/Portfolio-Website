## ⚠️ If Something Doesn't Work:

### Ripple not showing?
- Try hard refresh: Cmd+Shift+R
- Check browser console for errors (F12 → Console)

### DNA dividers not visible?
- Scroll slowly between sections
- They're subtle - look for wavy lines
- Check if dark mode is affecting visibility

### Animations not triggering?
- Scroll slowly (not too fast)
- Each element animates once
- Hard refresh to reset

### Service worker not registered?
- Must be on localhost or HTTPS for production
- File:// protocol has limitations
- Check console for registration errors
