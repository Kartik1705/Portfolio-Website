## ✅ Feature 1: Loading Screen with DNA Helix

### How to Test:
1. **Hard refresh the page**: Press `Cmd + Shift + R` (Mac) or `Ctrl + Shift + F5` (Windows)
2. Look for:
   - Full-screen dark blue gradient background
   - Rotating DNA helix animation (two spinning rings)
   - Your name "KARTIK PANDYA" in large text
   - Tagline below your name
   - Progress bar at the bottom filling up
   - Smooth fade-out after loading completes

### Expected Behavior:
- ✅ Screen appears immediately on page load
- ✅ DNA helix rotates smoothly
- ✅ Progress bar fills from 0% to 100%
- ✅ Entire screen fades out after ~2 seconds
- ✅ Website content appears

### Troubleshooting:
- **If you don't see it**: Try closing the tab completely and opening `index.html` again
- **If it doesn't disappear**: Check browser console for errors (F12 → Console tab)
- **If it's too fast**: Normal! It shows for ~1-2 seconds

---

## ✅ Feature 2: Scroll Progress Bar

### How to Test:
1. Look at the **very top of the page** (above navigation)
2. Slowly scroll down the page
3. Watch the colored bar grow

### Expected Behavior:
- ✅ Thin colorful bar visible at the top edge
- ✅ Bar width = 0% when at top of page
- ✅ Bar grows as you scroll down
- ✅ Bar = 100% width when at bottom
- ✅ Bar has a glowing/pulsing effect
- ✅ Gradient colors: navy → blue → cream

### Troubleshooting:
- **If you don't see it**: It's only 4px tall - look at the VERY top edge above the navbar
- **If it doesn't move**: Try scrolling more - it updates in real-time
- **If it's stuck at 0%**: Check if JavaScript is enabled

## ✅ Feature 3: Dark Mode Toggle Button

### How to Test:
1. Look at the **top-right corner** of the page
2. You should see a round glassmorphic button with a moon icon 🌙
3. Click it

### Expected Behavior:
- ✅ Button is visible and floating in top-right
- ✅ Button has a glassmorphic (frosted glass) effect
- ✅ Hovering over it makes it lift up
- ✅ Shows moon icon 🌙 in light mode
- ✅ Shows sun icon ☀️ in dark mode

### Troubleshooting:
- **If you don't see it**: Look in the TOP-RIGHT corner (position: fixed)
- **If it's behind something**: It should have z-index: 99999
- **If icons don't appear**: Check if Font Awesome is loaded in `index.html`

---

## ✅ Feature 4: Dark Mode Theme Switch

### How to Test:
1. Click the theme toggle button (top-right)
2. Watch the entire page transition

### Expected Behavior:
**When switching to DARK mode:**
- ✅ Background changes from cream to deep navy/black
- ✅ Text changes from navy to cream
- ✅ All cards/sections invert colors
- ✅ Transition is smooth (0.6 seconds)
- ✅ Toggle button rotates 360° on click
- ✅ Moon icon 🌙 changes to sun icon ☀️

**When switching to LIGHT mode:**
- ✅ Everything reverses back
- ✅ Smooth transition again
- ✅ Sun icon ☀️ changes back to moon 🌙

### Troubleshooting:
- **If nothing happens**: Check browser console for errors
- **If it's instant (no transition)**: The CSS might need to load
- **If some elements don't change**: This is normal - we'll fix all elements in Phase 2

## ✅ Feature 5: Dark Mode Persistence

### How to Test:
1. Switch to dark mode (click toggle)
2. **Refresh the page** (Cmd+R or F5)
3. Dark mode should still be active
4. Close the browser tab completely
5. Reopen `index.html`
6. Dark mode should STILL be active

### Expected Behavior:
- ✅ Theme persists after refresh
- ✅ Theme persists after closing/reopening browser
- ✅ Uses localStorage to remember preference

### Troubleshooting:
- **If theme resets**: Check if localStorage is enabled in browser
- **If it goes back to light**: Open DevTools → Application → Local Storage → check for 'theme' key

---

## ✅ Feature 6: Smooth Scrolling

### How to Test:
1. Click any navigation link (Experience, Education, Projects, etc.)
2. Watch the page scroll

### Expected Behavior:
- ✅ Page scrolls smoothly (not instant jump)
- ✅ Scrolling is animated
- ✅ Takes ~0.5-1 second to reach target
- ✅ Content doesn't hide under navbar

### Troubleshooting:
- **If it jumps instantly**: Check if `scroll-behavior: smooth` is in CSS
- **If content hides under navbar**: The `scroll-padding-top: 80px` should prevent this

---

## ✅ Feature 7: PWA Manifest

### How to Test:
1. Open browser DevTools (F12)
2. Go to "Application" tab (Chrome) or "Storage" tab (Firefox)
3. Click "Manifest" in the sidebar
4. You should see app details

### Expected Behavior:
- ✅ Manifest loads without errors
- ✅ Shows app name: "Kartik Pandya - Product Manager..."
- ✅ Shows theme color: #314C6F
- ✅ Shows background color: #1F3C5C
- ✅ Lists icon paths (icons don't exist yet - that's OK!)

### Troubleshooting:
- **If manifest doesn't load**: Check if `manifest.json` path is correct in `index.html`
- **If icons show errors**: Normal! We haven't created the icon images yet

## 🐛 Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: Loading screen doesn't show
**Solution**: Hard refresh with cache clear (Cmd+Shift+R or Ctrl+Shift+F5)

### Issue: Dark mode button not visible
**Solution**: Check if it's hidden behind the profile availability badge (also in top-right). We may need to adjust positioning.

### Issue: Some sections don't change in dark mode
**Solution**: This is expected! We'll add dark mode styling to all sections in Phase 2. Right now, only the main background and text change.

### Issue: Scroll progress bar not visible
**Solution**: It's only 4px tall. Look at the absolute top edge of the browser window.

### Issue: Console errors about missing icons
**Solution**: Normal! We referenced icon files in manifest.json but haven't created them yet. That's next session.
